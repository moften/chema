Chema

Chema is a powerful security tool designed to help security professionals bypass web applications by embedding a shell into an image file. This technique enables stealthy operations, allowing for effective penetration testing and security evaluations without triggering common detection mechanisms.

About

Chema leverages the technique of steganography to hide shell commands within images. By embedding a shell directly into an image, security professionals can execute commands undetected, bypassing certain security restrictions of web applications. This makes Chema an ideal tool for penetration testing scenarios where stealth and efficiency are crucial.

Note: Chema is intended for ethical use by certified security professionals. Unauthorized or malicious use of this tool is strictly prohibited.
